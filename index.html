    <h2>My Blog</h2>
    <p>This here is my blog. It was the first website I fully created from scratch using my imagination during my second semester attending BYU-I.
      I still add new features to the site as I learn more about code.

    <h2>Game recording</h2>
    <p>This is a simple website I made. The goal was to make a site where I could record the scores of board games my family played and keep track of who one (etc.)</p>

    <h2>Shopping Route Generator</h2>
    <p>This is my favorite. I use it often. The goal for this was to create something I wanted to see on a website that didn't exist. In this case, it was
      a shopping route generator for the Walmart site. I feel like this makes shopping trips a lot easier, quicker, and more efficient.
